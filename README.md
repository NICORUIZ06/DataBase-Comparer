# DataBase Comparer
Useful tool to compare two (SqlServer) databases and get differences between them (Schema only)

# Usage
When you execute the application, a Windows console will appear.

It will ask for some configuration data, for instance primary server/database, and secondary server/database.

This will all be mandatory information to start comparing every schema from both databases.

After the "Ready!" message, either an error or success log will appear in your desktop with all the diferences that were found.

If you want to, you can contribute to this project adding / updating functionalities

Thank you all!
